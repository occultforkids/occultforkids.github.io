<h1 class="h1">What is Sex in occult world view?</h1>
<p>
	It's a process of crossing one's energies into another or mixing of energies depending on the individuals partaking in the act.
	<br/>
	When a person of higher frequency/energy attaches their part to someone's part who is of lower frequesncy then som eof the energy from the higher frequency person will travel through the sexual chakra of lower frequency person and the kundalini will rise. The energy will travel on eby one through lower chakras to the upper chakraz and will go down through the back so the energy travels through front upwards and comes down through the back side of the chakras in the body. At the end the energy travels back into the higher frequency person because the lower frequency/energy person has now become of the same frequency/energy.

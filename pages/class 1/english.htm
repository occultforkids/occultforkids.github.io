<h1 class="h1">Alphabets</h1>

<p>
	Alphabet word came from two Greek letters namely "Alpha" and "Beta". Alpha is the begining of the 
	 greek script and Beta is the second letter of it. Alphabet have their origin in ancient egyptian 
	 hyroglyphs. Hyroglyphs are symbology used to represent sound and multiple symbols combined making
	 a world to represent something that they individually do not. Similarly every letter in the english
	 alphabet has a separate meaning and can be used a singleton sigil.

<p style="color: red;">Caution: I do not take responsibility for any symbols you make combining any letters or any other symbol or symbols or anything else. The symbols above work, but if you don't know how to combine them then just don't.</p>
<p style="color: blue;">The symbol JV is J capital for Hand/Reach and V for soul in it's arch. The Arch represents the Arched ones (true archons). My symbol has V on J just above the arch.</p>

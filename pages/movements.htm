<h2>Head Movements</h2>
<p>
	* Tilt head left to understand better, tilt right to argue better (Also helpful in avoiding astral attacks).
	* Touch the bottom part of the ears to reduce the negative energy projected by the vampires.
	* Touch the top of the upper lip with left index finger and bottom of the bottom lip with the right index finger to circulate red and blue energies in the mouth properly so vampires can't communicate with your subconsciousness.
	* Touch the center of the forehead with left index finger and chin with right index finger to see what's been hidden from you and do the opposite to hide yourself from attackers in the astral.

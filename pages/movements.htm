<h1>Movements</h1>
<h2>Head Movements</h2>
<p>
	* Tilt head left to understand better, tilt right to argue better (Also helpful in avoiding astral attacks).
	* Touch the bottom part of the ears to reduce the negative energy projected by the vampires.
	* Touch the top of the upper lip with left index finger and bottom of the bottom lip with the right index finger to circulate red and blue energies in the mouth properly so vampires can't communicate with your subconsciousness.
	* Touch the center of the forehead with left index finger and chin with right index finger to see what's been hidden from you and do the opposite to hide yourself from attackers in the astral.


	* move eyes to the left and suddenly look to the front, it will throw some kind of attack that I'm not able to explain properly, once I saw red colored balls flying out and other time I saw something flying out and attacking an entity which was completely different from before it seems.

	Some important points about eyes:-
	* Vampires live staring into other people's eyes, they want to play with memeories, thoughts and feelings of others.
	* Never close your eyes in front of others, always look away before closing them. Don't close your eyes in fornt of
	 a mirror or reflective objects like TV and mobile screens. Eyes can be a portal to your inside world; never bring 
	 strange things inside you.
	* There are two modes of perception in human mind. One mode takes the information inside the conscious and processes
	 it, criticizes it and decides if the data is to be accepted or not. The other mode simply accepts the data as it is 
	 and is more prone to psychic attacks. The second mode is very helpful in analysing information that the conscious
	 mind can not handle at the same speed at which subconscious mind can. Vampires often take advantage of the subconscious mode.
	* When you close your eyes; your heart, mind and perspective kinda tries to return to the body. To prevent that vampires
	 use smoke magic, shadow magic, time magic, space magic commonly so they can feed on those aspects of you. They might also use other forms of magic as well. So you better take care of them and never loose them at all. I use computer glasses to save my eyes from smoke magic and blue light magic, you might want to develop your own techniques to save you from these types of magic. Blue light filter is also nice.

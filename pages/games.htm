<h1 class="h1">Games</h1>
<p>
	God sent us on earth to play games, but we got memory wiped and 
	 stolen from our origins that we forgot that life was just a game.
	In modern world everything is a game, from arguments to actual childern's
	 games.
	You should always avoid playing any games unless you are sure you will win.
	Avoid watching movies and listening to songs without affirming to yourself
	 that there are no games and if there are any then you won't play them.
</p>

<h2 class="h2">End dream related games.</h2>
<p>
	The dream related games are the most problamatic in my experience.
	You can't stop playing them easily and they just keep on recreating themselves.
	To end all games you need to draw the sigil below on a paper, place your hand on it and say "I end all dream related games."

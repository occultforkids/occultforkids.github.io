<h1 class="h1">Introduction!</h1>
<p class="p">
	If you are in the first class/grade then your techer must have taught
	 you how to form spells and how to write alphabests, but she wouldn't
	 teach you what the alphabests mean and how they originated.
	Most kids end up relying on their family magic because teachers don't
	 teach academic magic properly and kids don't find it useful much; 
	 until they become adults and really have to use it for research or 
	 get approached by an order for initiation in College/University.
	This creates a lot discrimination and inequality between kids from
	 powerful families who have complete magic systems and kids of those 
	 who got initiated later or even worse for those who don't even realize
	 that they are being taught magic and the whole class is being taught 
	 magic subliminally. 
	Kids from non occultic background end up 
	 being treated like cattle and they don't realise why they got bullied
	 throughout their school life and why some people were extra nice, 
	 friendly and even touchy after they have started working a job. 
	I have decided to put things out in the obvious for those who were never
	 able to grasp the concepts that were laid out in front of them to read
	 due to certain laws of nature.
	It's a right to know the things you should know. Should be delivered
	 in full, the things you have paid for, as it is the reptilian law.

	Below are the 4 subjects that I believe to be crucial for the development of a child.
	I wasn't good at other subjects, but these I'm confident in and should be able to 
	 lay out correctly.

	<ul>
		<li>English</li>
		<li>Maths</li>
		<li>Science</li>
		<li>Drawing</li>
	</ul>

	These subjects should be enough to be able to compete with the kids who come from
	 established occultic backgrounds and with dedication and enough practice even the
	 vampires won't be able to do anything. That's how apt and capable the schooling 
	 magic system is.

	If you are one of those who spent their school time in a sedated state and never
	 had a chance to even know what occult is then you probably might wanna start from
	 learning aphabets [<a href="#!class1/english">English class 1</a>].
